# LOAD BALANCER

The load balancer is used to reduce system load, in the case of our system it is done using the round robin technique that sends traffic to the sever that is least active or busy.


# SERVERS

Cloning the existing server and creating a new server helps to reduce downtime by ensuring users can always access data in situations where one of the servers is unresponsive or maintanance is being done on one of the servers.
